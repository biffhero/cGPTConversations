* Q1
Please help me understand option pricing
* A1
Option pricing is the process of determining the value of an option,
which is a contract that gives the holder the right but not the
obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price
and time.

The price of an option is determined by a number of factors, including
the current market price of the underlying asset, the strike price of
the option, the time remaining until expiration, and the volatility of
the underlying asset's price.

There are several models used to price options, including the
Black-Scholes model and the binomial option pricing model. These
models use various assumptions and calculations to estimate the fair
value of an option.

The Black-Scholes model, for example, uses the following inputs to
determine the price of a call option:

    The current market price of the underlying asset
    The strike price of the option
    The time remaining until expiration
    The risk-free interest rate
    The volatility of the underlying asset's price

Once these inputs are known, the Black-Scholes model uses a complex
formula to estimate the fair value of the option. The formula takes
into account the probability of the underlying asset's price
increasing or decreasing over the option's time horizon, as well as
the expected return on the option if it is exercised.

Option pricing can be a complex topic, and there are many variables to
consider when determining the fair value of an option. However,
understanding the basic principles behind option pricing can be
helpful for investors who are considering trading options or
incorporating them into their investment strategies.

* Q2

Thank you. I will need to build a spreadsheet to figure out how to
price an option, can you help me learn how to do that?

* A2
Sure, I can provide you with some guidance on building a spreadsheet
to price an option.

First, you need to determine the inputs for your model. The most
important inputs are:

    Underlying asset price: This is the current market price of the asset that the option is based on.
    Strike price: This is the price at which the option can be exercised.
    Time to expiration: This is the amount of time remaining until the option expires.
    Interest rate: This is the risk-free interest rate that can be earned on cash invested in the market.
    Volatility: This is a measure of how much the underlying asset price fluctuates over time.

Once you have these inputs, you can use an option pricing model such
as the Black-Scholes model or the binomial option pricing model to
calculate the fair value of the option.

To build a spreadsheet for option pricing using the Black-Scholes
model, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new spreadsheet and label the first row with the input
    variables: underlying asset price, strike price, time to
    expiration, interest rate, and volatility.

2. In the second row, enter the values for each input variable.

3. In the third row, create a header for each of the output
   variables: call option price, put option price, delta, gamma,
   theta, and vega.

4. Use the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the call option price
   in cell B4. The formula for the call option price is:

   == NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) + (B4+(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0)B2 - NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) + (B4-(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0)B3EXP(-B7B6)=

  This formula calculates the expected present value of the option's
  payoff at expiration, taking into account the probability of the
  underlying asset price increasing or decreasing over the option's time
  horizon.

5. Use the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the put option price in
   cell C4. The formula for the put option price is:
   == NORM.S.DIST((-LN(B2/B3) + (B4+(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0)B3EXP(-B7*B6) - NORM.S.DIST((-LN(B2/B3) + (B4-(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0)*B2=

   This formula calculates the expected present value of the option's
   payoff at expiration, taking into account the probability of the
   underlying asset price increasing or decreasing over the option's
   time horizon.

6. Use the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the delta, gamma, theta,
   and vega values for the option in cells D4 to G4. These values
   represent the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the
   underlying asset price, time to expiration, and volatility.

   =Delta = NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) + (B4+(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0)=
   =Gamma = (NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) +
   (B4+(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0))/(B2B5SQRT(B6))=
   =Theta = -(B2*NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) + (B4+(B5^2/2))*B=

* Q3

Thank you, that is detailed. However, the answer is only complete
through Gamma. Could you please restate the answer, starting with
Theta?

* A3

Of course, here's a continuation of the instructions for building a
spreadsheet to price an option using the Black-Scholes model:

1. Use the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the delta, gamma, theta,
   and vega values for the option in cells D4 to G4. These values
   represent the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the
   underlying asset price, time to expiration, and volatility.
   =Theta = -(B2NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) + (B4+(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0))B5/(2SQRT(B6)) - B7B3*NORM.S.DIST((-LN(B2/B3) +
   (B4-(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0)EXP(-B7B6)=
   =Vega = B2*NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) + (B4+(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0)*SQRT(B6)=
   =Delta = NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) + (B4+(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0)=
   =Gamma = (NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3) + (B4+(B5^2/2))B6)/(B5SQRT(B6)),0))/(B2B5SQRT(B6))=

   These formulas use the same basic Black-Scholes formula as the call
   and put option price formulas in steps 4 and 5, but adjust the
   formula to calculate the option's sensitivity to changes in the
   underlying asset price, time to expiration, and volatility.
2. Finally, you can add some formatting to make the spreadsheet easier
   to read. You may want to format the input cells as currency or
   percentages, and the output cells as currency or decimals with a
   specified number of digits.

Once you have built your spreadsheet, you can use it to experiment
with different input values and see how they affect the option price
and its sensitivity measures. This can be a helpful tool for
understanding the factors that influence option pricing and for making
informed decisions about trading options.

* Q4
Thank 2,this is really helpful, I will use it in my studying about
trading later this afternoon. Would it be possible to use historical
data for the asset to calculate volatility?

* A4
Yes, you can use historical data for the underlying asset to estimate
its volatility. One common method for doing this is to calculate the
asset's historical standard deviation over a period of time, such as
the past month or year.

To calculate historical volatility, you can follow these steps:

1. Collect the historical data for the underlying asset, such as its daily closing prices, for a specific period of time.

2. Calculate the asset's daily returns by taking the percentage change
   in price from one day to the next. For example, if the closing price
   of the asset on day 1 is $100 and on day 2 is $105, then the 
   daily return for day 2 is (105 - 100)/100 = 0.05 or 5%.

3. Calculate the asset's standard deviation of daily returns using the
   formula STDEV.P() in Excel or a similar statistical software.

4. Annualize the standard deviation by multiplying it by the square
   root of the number of trading days in a year. For example, if you
   are using daily data, multiply the standard deviation by the square
   root of 252, which is the approximate number of trading days in a
   year.

5. Use the resulting annualized standard deviation as the estimate for
   the asset's volatility in the Black-Scholes model.

Note that historical volatility is only an estimate and may not
accurately reflect the asset's future volatility. Additionally,
different methods may be used to calculate volatility, such as implied
volatility derived from option prices, which is considered to be a
market-based estimate of the asset's expected future volatility.

* Q5
I see. Does this mean that historical volatility and implied
volatility are not the same?

* A5
Yes, historical volatility and implied volatility are not the same.

Historical volatility is calculated using the past price movements of
the underlying asset, while implied volatility is derived from the
market prices of options on the underlying asset.

Implied volatility reflects the market's expectation of the asset's
future volatility, based on the prices of options contracts that are
traded in the market. When option prices are higher, it suggests that
the market expects greater volatility in the underlying asset, and
when option prices are lower, it suggests that the market expects
lower volatility.

In contrast, historical volatility is a measure of the actual
volatility that the underlying asset has exhibited in the past. It may
or may not be a good predictor of the asset's future volatility, as
market conditions and other factors may change over time.

Traders and investors often use both historical volatility and implied
volatility to make informed decisions about option trading
strategies. They may compare the historical and implied volatility to
assess whether an option is relatively expensive or cheap, and adjust
their trading strategies accordingly.

* Q6
Thank you for the explanation. Can you please explain how implied
volatility is calculated in more detail, so I can put it into the
example spreadsheet above?
* A6
Certainly, here's a brief explanation of how to calculate implied
volatility in the Black-Scholes model:

1. Begin with the current market price of an option, which includes the current price of the underlying asset, the option's strike price, the time to expiration, and any other relevant factors that affect the option price.
2. Rearrange the Black-Scholes formula to solve for the implied volatility (sigma) instead of the option price (C). This can be done using numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method or the bisection method. These methods require a bit of coding, but they are relatively straightforward and can be implemented using Excel or other software.
3. Once you have found the implied volatility, you can use it in the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the option's sensitivity measures, such as delta, gamma, theta, and vega.

Here's an example of how to implement implied volatility calculation in the example spreadsheet:

1. Create a new input cell for implied volatility (sigma) in cell B8.
2. Modify the call and put option price formulas in cells B12 and B16, respectively, to include the implied volatility as an input parameter. The modified formulas will look like this:
   = Call: =B2NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3)+(B4+(B8^2/2))B6)/(B8SQRT(B6)),0)-B3EXP(-B7*B6)NORM.S.DIST((LN(B2/B3)+(B4+(B8^2/2))B6-B8SQRT(B6))/(B8SQRT(B6)),0)=
   = Put: =B3EXP(-B7B6)NORM.S.DIST((-LN(B2/B3)-(B4+(B8^2/2))B6)/(B8SQRT(B6)),0)-B2NORM.S.DIST((-LN(B2/B3)-(B4+(B8^2/2))B6+B8SQRT(B6))/(B8*SQRT(B6)),0)=
3. Use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method, to solve for implied volatility (sigma) in cell B8, based on the current market price of the option and the other input parameters.
4. Once you have found the implied volatility, you can use it in the formulas for delta, gamma, theta, and vega, as described in my previous answer.
Note that calculating implied volatility requires some advanced
mathematical techniques and may be challenging for beginners. However,
once you have built your spreadsheet, you can use it to experiment
with different input values and see how they affect the implied
volatility and other option pricing measures.

* Q7
Thank you. Does excel have the required numerical libraries to do the solving? 

* A7
Yes, Excel has several built-in numerical libraries that you can use to solve for implied volatility, such as the Solver add-in, which is included with most versions of Excel.

Solver is a powerful optimization tool that can be used to solve
complex nonlinear equations, such as the Black-Scholes equation for
implied volatility. To use Solver for this purpose, you will need to
set up a target cell that calculates the difference between the market
price of the option and the theoretical price calculated using the
Black-Scholes formula. You will then use Solver to minimize the
difference by adjusting the implied volatility input cell.

Here's a step-by-step guide for using Solver to calculate implied
volatility in Excel:

1. Open your Excel spreadsheet and enter the relevant inputs for the Black-Scholes formula, including the current price of the underlying asset, the option's strike price, the time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate, and the current market price of the option.
2. Create a new input cell for implied volatility and set an initial value for it, such as 0.2 (20%).
3. Create a target cell that calculates the difference between the market price of the option and the theoretical price calculated using the Black-Scholes formula, using the modified call or put option price formula described in my previous answer.
4. Open the Solver add-in by clicking on the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon and selecting "Solver" from the "Analysis" group.
5. In the Solver Parameters dialog box, set the "Set Objective" option to the target cell you created in step 3.
6. Set the "To" value to zero, since you want to minimize the difference between the market price and the theoretical price.
7. In the "By Changing Variable Cells" field, enter the reference to the implied volatility input cell you created in step 2.
8. Click the "Add" button to add a constraint that restricts the implied volatility to a reasonable range, such as between 0% and 100%.
9. Click "OK" to close the Add Constraint dialog box, and then click "OK" again to close the Solver Parameters dialog box.
10. Click "Solve" to run the Solver, and wait for it to find a solution. Once the Solver has converged, the implied volatility value in the input cell should be close to the actual implied volatility implied by the market price of the option.

Note that Solver may take some time to converge, especially if you
have a large spreadsheet or a complex model. You may need to
experiment with different initial values and constraints to help the
Solver converge faster. Additionally, be sure to verify the results of
your calculations and check them against other sources to ensure their
accuracy.

* Q8
OK, since IV requires option pricing, and all that I have is the historical price movements of the underlying, does that mean I know HV, but not IV? 

* A8
Yes, if all you have is historical price data of the underlying asset,
then you can calculate historical volatility (HV) based on that
data. However, HV is not the same as implied volatility (IV), which is
based on market expectations of future volatility.

Historical volatility is simply a measure of how much the price of the
underlying asset has fluctuated in the past, whereas implied
volatility is a measure of how much the market expects the price of
the underlying asset to fluctuate in the future.

So, while historical volatility can provide valuable information about
the behavior of the underlying asset, it does not provide any
information about how the market is pricing options on that asset. To
calculate implied volatility, you will need to use the current market
prices of options on the underlying asset, as well as the
Black-Scholes formula or other option pricing models.

In summary, historical volatility and implied volatility are two
different measures of volatility, and while historical volatility can
be calculated using historical price data, implied volatility requires
current market prices of options.

* Q9
I suppose this means that I could plug in the price of an option, and
that would tell me whether the IV is currently overstated or
understated. Is that correct?

* A9
Yes, that's correct. If you have the market price of an option, you
can use it along with the other inputs of the Black-Scholes formula
(such as the current price of the underlying asset, the option's
strike price, the time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate) to
solve for the implied volatility.

Once you have the implied volatility, you can compare it to the
historical volatility of the underlying asset. If the implied
volatility is higher than the historical volatility, it suggests that
the market expects the underlying asset to be more volatile in the
future than it has been in the past, and the option may be priced
relatively cheaply. On the other hand, if the implied volatility is
lower than the historical volatility, it suggests that the market
expects the underlying asset to be less volatile in the future than it
has been in the past, and the option may be priced relatively
expensively.

By comparing the implied volatility to the historical volatility, you
can get a sense of whether the current market price of the option is
overvalued or undervalued relative to the market's expectations of
future volatility. However, keep in mind that there may be other
factors that affect the price of the option, such as changes in
interest rates, changes in market sentiment, or changes in the supply
and demand for the option itself. Therefore, it's important to take a
comprehensive approach to analyzing the option and the underlying
asset before making any trading decisions.

* Q10
It seems that there is another missing piece of data that I will need
to guess at. The interest rate. How do I know what interest rate all
of the other players are using?

* A10
You're right that the interest rate is an important input to the
Black-Scholes formula and other option pricing models. In practice,
traders and analysts often use the risk-free interest rate, such as
the interest rate on short-term government bonds, as a proxy for the
interest rate in the formula. This is because the risk-free interest
rate is generally considered to be the closest approximation to a
"neutral" interest rate that reflects the time value of money and the
cost of borrowing.

The interest rate used in the formula can vary depending on the
specific circumstances of the option contract and the market
conditions. For example, for options on stocks, analysts may use the
short-term interest rate, such as the Federal Funds Rate in the United
States, while for options on currencies, they may use the overnight
interest rate differential between the two currencies.

In practice, traders and analysts may have different opinions about
the appropriate interest rate to use in the formula, and this can
affect the calculated price and implied volatility of the
option. However, in general, the interest rate used in the formula
should reflect the prevailing market conditions and expectations, and
should be adjusted as necessary based on changes in those conditions.

If you're not sure what interest rate to use in your calculation, you
can start by using the risk-free interest rate as a default, and
adjust it as needed based on your analysis of market conditions and
expectations.

* Q11
Where would I find the risk free interest rate?
* A11
The risk-free interest rate is typically the interest rate on
short-term government bonds, such as Treasury bills in the United
States, or government bonds in other countries. These bonds are
considered to be "risk-free" because they are backed by the full faith
and credit of the government and are considered to be the safest
investments available.

In the United States, the risk-free interest rate is often represented
by the Federal Funds Rate, which is the interest rate that banks
charge each other for overnight loans. The Federal Reserve, which is
the central bank of the United States, sets the Federal Funds Rate
based on its assessment of the state of the economy and its goals for
price stability and full employment.

You can find current and historical data on the Federal Funds Rate and
other interest rates on the website of the Federal Reserve or other
central banks. Financial news sources, such as Bloomberg or Reuters,
also typically provide up-to-date information on interest rates and
market conditions.

* Q12
How often should I update this value in the spreadsheet?

* A12
The frequency with which you update the risk-free interest rate in
your option pricing spreadsheet may depend on your trading strategy
and the time horizon of your option positions. In general, it's a good
practice to update the interest rate periodically to reflect changes
in the market and to ensure that your option prices and implied
volatilities are up-to-date.

If you're trading shorter-term options, you may want to update the
interest rate more frequently, such as daily or weekly, to account for
changes in the Federal Funds Rate or other short-term interest
rates. If you're trading longer-term options, you may want to update
the interest rate less frequently, such as monthly or quarterly, as
long as there are no major changes in the market conditions.

It's important to note that the risk-free interest rate is just one of
many inputs that affect option pricing and implied volatility. Changes
in other factors, such as the price of the underlying asset, the time
to expiration, and the supply and demand for the option, can also
affect the price and implied volatility of the option. Therefore, it's
important to take a comprehensive approach to analyzing options and
the underlying assets before making any trading decisions.

* Q13
I understand, and the underlying, time to expiration, etc are all
easily known, and not subject to errors in collection. It seems that
if I were to update one time per day, that would be enough for current
prices.

* A13
Yes, updating the interest rate once per day may be sufficient for
many trading strategies, especially if you're trading shorter-term
options. However, if you're trading longer-term options or if there
are major changes in the market conditions, you may want to update the
interest rate more frequently to ensure that your option prices and
implied volatilities reflect the latest information.

It's important to note that the risk-free interest rate is just one of
many inputs that affect option pricing and implied volatility. Changes
in other factors, such as the price of the underlying asset, the time
to expiration, and the supply and demand for the option, can also
affect the price and implied volatility of the option. Therefore, it's
important to take a comprehensive approach to analyzing options and
the underlying assets before making any trading decisions.

* Q14
How can the supply or demand for the option have an impact on the fair
price?

* A14
The supply and demand for an option can affect its fair price in the
market. The fair price of an option is determined by the market
participants who are buying and selling the option, based on their
assessment of the risk and potential rewards of the underlying asset.

If there is high demand for a particular option, the price of that
option is likely to increase, all else being equal. Conversely, if
there is low demand for an option, its price may decrease. This is
because buyers are willing to pay a higher price for an option that
they believe has a greater chance of being profitable, while sellers
are willing to accept a lower price for an option that they believe
has a lower chance of being profitable.

The supply and demand for an option can be influenced by a variety of
factors, such as changes in market conditions, news events, and
investor sentiment. For example, if a positive earnings report is
released for the underlying asset of an option, there may be increased
demand for call options on that asset, as investors expect the price
of the asset to increase. Conversely, if a negative news event occurs,
such as a major lawsuit or regulatory action, there may be increased
demand for put options on that asset, as investors expect the price of
the asset to decrease.

It's important to consider the supply and demand for an option when
evaluating its fair price and making trading decisions. However, it's
also important to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the underlying
asset, option pricing inputs, and market conditions before making any
trades.

* Q15
Hrm.

* A15
Is there anything else I can help you with? If you have any specific
questions or areas of confusion, I would be happy to try and provide
further clarification.

* Q16

Yes, I have more questions. It seems that I should be able to create a
spreadsheet that tracks the fair price of an entire option chain, and
compare that with the actual prices, which, when compared, would be
able to show me the implied volatility of the options, and also tell
me the strikes which are most mis priced, as compared to the other
strikes.

* A16

Yes, you can create a spreadsheet that tracks the fair prices of an entire option chain and compares it to the actual prices. This can give you an idea of which options are overpriced or underpriced, and you can use this information to make trading decisions.

To create such a spreadsheet, you would need to use the Black-Scholes model or another pricing model to calculate the fair prices of the options in the chain. You can then compare these prices with the actual prices in the market to determine whether the options are overpriced or underpriced.

To determine the implied volatility of the options, you can use the same method that we discussed earlier: plug in the actual prices of the options and solve for the implied volatility using the Black-Scholes model or another pricing model.

Once you have determined the implied volatility of each option, you can compare the implied volatilities across the different strikes to identify any patterns or anomalies. For example, you may find that the implied volatility is higher for out-of-the-money options than for at-the-money options, which could indicate that the market expects more volatility in the underlying asset in the future.

You can also use the differences between the fair prices and the
actual prices to identify options that are mispriced. For example, if
the fair price of an option is significantly higher than the actual
price, that option may be a good candidate for a buy trade, since it
may be undervalued by the market. Conversely, if the fair price of an
option is significantly lower than the actual price, that option may
be a good candidate for a sell trade, since it may be overvalued by
the market.

Overall, creating a spreadsheet to track the fair prices of an option
chain can be a useful tool for identifying mispricings and making
trading decisions. However, it's important to remember that no model
is perfect, and there are many factors that can affect the prices and
implied volatilities of options. Therefore, it's important to conduct
a comprehensive analysis of the market and the underlying asset before
making any trades.

* Q17
If I had access to one minute pricing data for the SPX, and one
minutes pricing data for the SPX, could you create a python program
that would show the overpricing or underpricing in each option, one
minute at a time?

* A17
Yes, it is possible to create a Python program that uses historical
minute-by-minute data for the SPX and option prices to calculate the
fair prices of options and compare them to the actual prices in the
market. Here's a high-level overview of how you could go about doing
this:

  1. Collect the historical minute-by-minute price data for the SPX and the option prices you want to analyze.

  2. Use a Python library like pandas to manipulate the data and calculate the relevant parameters, such as the implied volatility and fair prices for each option using the Black-Scholes model.

  3. Compare the calculated fair prices with the actual prices in the market to identify overpriced or underpriced options.

  4. Output the results to a file or display them in a dashboard or other visualization tool.

There are many libraries and tools available in Python that can help
with this type of analysis, including pandas, numpy, scipy, and
matplotlib, to name a few. However, creating a robust program that can
handle all of the data and calculations involved can be complex, so it
may be helpful to work with a skilled developer or data scientist to
create the program.

It's also worth noting that historical data is just one piece of the
puzzle when it comes to option pricing and trading decisions. Market
conditions and other factors can change quickly and unpredictably, so
it's important to supplement historical data with real-time
information and analysis.

* Q18
Certainly. I suppose I would also want the daily interest date
date. Is that correct?

* A18
Yes, including the current daily interest rate in your program would
be important for accurately calculating option prices using the
Black-Scholes model. The interest rate is a key component of the
formula, and changes in interest rates can have a significant impact
on option prices. You may be able to obtain current daily interest
rates from financial news sources or websites that provide financial
data, such as Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg.

* Q19
Please write me a python program using the pandas library that does
all of this. I have the end of day SPX option data from options dx. I
would like to backtest the results of selling a 16 delta, 50 wide iron
Condor, 45 DTE, and taking profit at 50% of the credit received, stop
loss at 300% of the credit received, and closing the position at 21
DTE. I want to compare against 25 wide as well.

* A19
Here is an example Python program that should help you get started
with backtesting your iron condor trading strategy using the

Yes, you can compare the results of the two strategies and print out

#+END_SRC

This program will now backtest both the 50 wide and 25 wide iron
condor strategies, and print out the results for both. It will also
compare the two strategies and print out the one with the highest P&L
per trade.

* Q22
Thank you, I will test this out. How does this code know what an iron
Condor is?

* A22
The code does not "know" what an iron condor is. An iron condor is a specific options trading strategy that involves selling both a call spread and a put spread with the same expiration date but different strike prices.

In the code, the iron condor is constructed by selecting the options with the appropriate delta range and strike prices, and then calculating the net credit received for selling the spreads. The program then monitors the positions and adjusts them according to the predetermined profit target and stop loss.

The code assumes that the user knows how to construct and manage an
iron condor strategy and only provides a framework for backtesting the
strategy using historical data.

* Q23

hitting the profit target or the stop loss.

at in a spreadsheet
